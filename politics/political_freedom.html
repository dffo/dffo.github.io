Yet that dignity is betrayed by the limits of our world—by our ability to know, to give, and to protect. The claim to human dignity is therefore not a program but a dream, a belief that we are all endowed by nature with a shared claim to a decent life.</p><p>That we are born with a  natural dignity does not mean that we are born with natural <em>rights</em>. For the natural state of man is anarchy—what rights can exist in such a condition but that of the strong to bully the weak? In nature, anarchy is not a choice but a necessity: if you suspect that another tribe will attack your own, the only option is to bear arms and strike first. Power is a zero-sum game, and time is its currency.</p><p>Freedom can only begin to breathe when every tribe agrees to yield its arms to a central government, an arbiter whose use of force is bound by rules consecrated with trust. Freedom therefore requires a sublime act of faith, a faith bound by a shared belief in the dignity that lives within every human soul. This faith is the first step, but it must be nourished over time by the fruits of a society that constrains power with rules. To conquer tyranny is therefore not to fight, but to surrender: to submit oneself to the <i>rule of law</i>. The laws that bind society are not static but mature with its people, who revise them over time in keeping with their evolving standards of human decency.</p><p>But laws themselves are born of the limits of our world. It is life’s constraints that give meaning to crime: mortality permits violence, inequality permits theft, ignorance permits fraud. Laws are a necessary evil, limiting one’s freedom to act  to protect another’s dignity. Such guarantees are called <em>rights</em>, yet there is nothing intrinsically right about them. Why should we guarantee a man’s riches even as the poorest starve? Why should we guarantee his right to speak even as he lies and defames? Why should we guarantee his right to bear arms even as scores are cut down in the streets with brutish violence?</p><p>The answer is simple: the rights adopted by society reflect its current agreement on the tradeoffs between the freedom to act and the price of harm. Their limits and contours are not ideological but empirical; not rigid, but flexible. A society may grant the freedom to insult, but not libel; to bear arms, but not hide them; to own wealth, but pay taxes. The legitimacy of the compromise rests not on metaphysical dogma, but an evolving popular consensus—a consensus that lives so long as dissent can thrive.</p><p><em>This is political freedom</em>: the freedom for a people to criticize, scrutinize, and elect leaders who are empowered to write laws that address their concerns through compromise and debate. It is a freedom that inheres in every citizen, who grants their government a share of their inalienable sovereignty—a freedom for the people to be their own masters, without having their concerns dismissed by a dogmatic, technocratic, or judicial caste.  It calls for a system that places the general interest of preserving human dignity above the claims of any individual faction: a system of <i>majority rule</i>.</p><hr class="asterism"/><p>But though we have made the <em>moral</em> case for political freedom, appeals to democracy and self-government aren’t enough in a world where generations have been taught to fear majority rule and the tyranny it would seem to imply. How can we trust the people to govern themselves with restraint? Would they not simply use that power to bully minorities and enrich the well-connected few? Why should we not establish a council of wise judges to gently guide the people away from such tyrannical laws? To answer these charges, we must descend back to Earth and explore the nature of governing institutions.</p><p><em>Democracy is majority rule</em>. The most sacred role of a democratic system is to promote the general welfare over the special interest. The general welfare is by definition a <em>majoritarian</em> interest, while the special interest is a minoritarian one. Democracy must therefore serve the majority by default, with concessions made only where no other alternative exists. This may seem a recipe for tyranny. Yet our shared humanity means that policies which promote the general welfare benefit minority and majority alike. We all benefit from economic growth and stable prices. We all want to feel safe in our homes and communities. We all want to leave the world a better place than we found it.</p><p>Yet sometimes our earnest efforts to cultivate a decent society cause harm. We may hurt minority groups because we don’t appreciate the dangers our laws pose to their dignity. Or perhaps we don’t even realize they <em>exist</em> as a group deserving our help. <i>National minorities</i> based around ethnicity, religion, and language often capture the world’s attention, but they are the easy ones to identify. It is the <i>embedded minorities</i>  that exist within communities—those based around ability, gender, or even handedness—that are trickier to identify as needing special consideration.</p><p>Of course a decent society must look out for its minorities. But this is often not a matter of will, but <em>knowledge</em>. Every human being carries a layered set of identities: a citizen, a parent, a worker. Each of us could be considered a minority at some level of generality, but a society that promotes human dignity must find some way to discern the vulnerable minority from the mere special interest.</p><p>The line between the two may seem obvious, but it seldom is; indeed, it often hinges not on the group itself, but what they are asking of us. A civil rights group may fight for both desegregation and racial quotas; yet the former proscribes discrimination while the latter requires it. Perhaps both are necessary, but each must be scrutinized on its own merits. Simple, mechanistic solutions <em>do not</em> work, because they are far more likely to be seized by entrenched interests than struggling minorities. America’s filibuster was explicitly meant to protect minorities, but mainly allowed white Southerners to block civil rights. The only real solution is deliberation.</p><p>Such a task may seem foolish to entrust to a majoritarian government. Why would the majority bother wrestling with such questions instead of ignoring minorities outright?  The answer is simple: laws that protect liberty benefit everyone. They defuse social tension, enhance institutional trust, and hearten those of us who believe in fighting for human dignity. Because laws that protect liberty are <em>positive-sum</em> in this way, a society that remains politically free tends to move inexorably towards tolerance and goodwill—<em>so long as</em> each step is freely chosen, and generous rather than punitive.</p><p>But even liberty cannot always be absolute. Protecting the general welfare forces us to recognize that individual actions can harm society <em>collectively</em>,  requiring laws that focus these diffuse costs back onto the individual. This is not just true for environmental harms like pollution.  It is also true for actions that erode cultural cohesion and the rule of law—think public urination, nudity, or drunkenness. Yes, appeals to the social fabric can be taken too far, especially by social conservatives who fret about moral decay. But the underlying principle is sound; and any imagined harms will yield over time to social pressure so long as minorities remain free to dissent and petition the majority.</p><p>The task of a free society is thus clear. It must strive above all to promote the general welfare, balancing personal liberty with the risk of collective harm.  It must recognize groups that deserve special protection: first by acknowledging their existence and vulnerability, and then by judging each request on its own terms, seeking to expand liberty without giving privileges at others’ expense. It is a bewildering problem, one that requires more knowledge than any one person or campus can provide. It is a problem that is best answered by a <em>parliament</em>: the organ with the greatest concentration of rational knowledge in a society—and the most democratic legitimacy.</p><hr class="asterism"/><p>The problem of governance requires not just science or economics, but a deeper kind of knowledge: the ordered set of preferences and values held by every human being within society. Governing well is not about finding a <em>right answer</em>, but about choosing the tradeoffs that minimize social friction while hedging against the chance that a policy will prove unnecessary or fail—an existential risk for institutions that thrive on trust. Take climate change: fossil fuels have lifted millions out of poverty. How readily should we abandon them, even as billions more yearn to follow? The answer hinges not on morals but <em>risk</em>, one that must be finely tuned to minimize angst and misery. It requires a knowledge beyond the ken of any technocrat or judge.</p><p>Such knowledge lives in a democratic parliament, seeded with the high-stakes decisions of all its voters. At the ballot box, each citizen weighs his layered identities, hopes, and fears, and votes based on which one matters most at that moment. Politicians race to address these concerns, and the most convincing one gets a temporary lease on power. But even after winning, the government must take pains to avoid alienating voters, lest it imperil its chance of reelection. Democracy is a constant dialogue between parliament and society. Pollsters, analysts, focus groups: all  information sought out for political survival. The scientists and scholars matter too, but only if parliament believes the voters can bear their prescriptions—or trust them.</p><p>A democracy is nothing but a parliament and its people. Rights, precedents, and norms live within the people, not on vellum. They therefore live and die by majority rule alone: in a crisis, a leader who ignores the laws and flouts the courts can only be disciplined by voters. Such a result would breed chaos, replacing predictable laws with personal whim; yet  it is the likely outcome if a country’s laws are frozen by courts. Its cause is a fundamental hubris: if rights are contingent and change as we try to better protect human dignity, then declaring them to be immutable assumes what we are trying to learn. The system will hold while people still have faith in the constitution. Yet by blocking efforts to solve festering problems, the system makes that faith less likely.</p><p>Some would respond to this brittleness by giving judges an ever more active role in protecting rights. Yet for all the real or imagined mistakes a parliament could make,  why would a court do any better? The dangers  are far from hypothetical: In Venezuela, the high court gave  their strongman president despotic powers; in Thailand, they  blocked liberal, reform-minded parties; in Bolivia, they  allowed an authoritarian incumbent to skirt term limits;  and in the United States, they endorsed segregation and eugenics. This may seem surprising, but it shouldn’t:  compared to the deep well of knowledge that flows through  a parliament, that of a court is shallow, still, and stale.</p><p>Democracy has never been perfect. It has erred time and again. But it alone carries the means for redemption and reform: rich in knowledge, drawn from the people, refreshed over time through elections. That is the essence of political freedom: the power for a people to learn from the bitter experience of their own mistakes. Yes, uniting a society fractured by tongue and sect is hard. But the best solution for holding together such diversity is through <em>more</em> democracy, by crafting federal systems that force states to compete with each other. Sovereignty is not limited, but redirected. The people can still choose, but they can also move—and such threats themselves can chasten.</p><p><sc>All human beings</sc> are born with a dignity greater than the entire universe. Yet for most of man’s existence, that dignity was betrayed by the limits of human rule, yielding tyranny, hunger, and death. It was through political freedom that human dignity became not just a dream, but a program. Its progress was made not in spite of its errors, but because of them. Yes, the mistakes hurt. Their scars still humble us today. But so long as political freedom remained, the people could always reclaim the rights they had let decay. In that sense, political freedom is the wellspring of all other rights. Once given away, it is gone forever. There can be no more pressing a case for it than that. <end-mark></end-mark></p>
