◊initial-cap{All human beings} are born with a dignity greater than the entire
universe. Yet that dignity is betrayed by the limits of our world—by our
ability to know, to give, and to protect. The claim to human dignity is
therefore not a program but a dream, a belief that we are all endowed
by nature with a shared claim to a decent life.

That we are born with a  natural dignity does not mean that we are
born with natural ◊em{rights}. For the natural state of man is anarchy—what
rights can exist in such a condition but that of the strong to bully the
weak? In nature, anarchy is not a choice but a necessity: if you
suspect that another tribe will attack your own, the only option
is to bear arms and strike first. Power is a zero-sum game, and time is
its currency.

Freedom can only begin to breathe when every tribe agrees to yield its
arms to a central government, an arbiter whose use of force is bound by rules
consecrated with trust. Freedom therefore requires a sublime act of faith,
a faith bound by a shared belief in the dignity that
lives within every human soul.
This faith is the first step, but it must be nourished over time by
the fruits of a society that constrains power with rules. To conquer
tyranny is therefore not to fight, but to surrender: to submit oneself
to the ◊i{rule of law}.
The laws that bind society are not static but mature with its people,
who revise them over time in keeping with
their evolving standards of human decency.

But laws are only needed because of the limits of our world.
Mortality makes us fear violence; scarcity makes us fear theft;
uncertainty makes us fear fraud.
Without these limitations, man could act without restraint.
With them, his actions can harm others.
Laws are thus a necessary evil, curbing one's
freedom to act to protect another's dignity. Such guarantees
are called ◊em{rights}, yet there is nothing intrinsically right
about them. Why should we guarantee a man's riches even as
the poorest starve? Why should we guarantee his right to speak
even as he lies and defames? Why should
we guarantee his right to bear arms even as scores are
killed in mass shootings?

The answer is simple: the rights adopted by society reflect its
current agreement on the tradeoffs between the freedom to act
and the price of harm. Their limits and contours are not ideological
but empirical; not rigid, but flexible.
A society may grant the freedom to insult, but not libel;
to bear arms, but not hide them; to own wealth,
but pay taxes. The legitimacy of the compromise rests not 
on metaphysical dogma, but an evolving popular consensus—a consensus that lives
so long as dissent can thrive.

◊em{This is political freedom}: the freedom for a people to criticize,
scrutinize, and elect
leaders who are empowered to write laws that address their concerns 
through compromise and debate. It is a freedom that inheres in
every citizen, who grants their government a share of their inalienable
sovereignty—a freedom for the people to be their own
masters, without having their concerns dismissed by a dogmatic,
technocratic, or judicial caste.
 It calls for a system that places the general
interest of preserving human dignity above the claims of any 
individual faction: a system of ◊i{majority rule}.

◊(asterism)

◊;{
Now you write about how the people entrust their sovereignty with a parliament,
and how their shared aims to further human dignity is helped by using parliament
as an epistemic filter; how parliament concentrates more knowledge, refreshed
through elections, than any other centralized institution in the country, and
how parliament distinguishes between minority claims and special interest claims
by allowing any group to petition the majority by appealing to their common
core of human dignity (weighed against the personal cost of accepting the claim,
whether in terms of other citizens' freedom or otherwise).
}

But though we have made the ◊em{moral} case for political freedom,
appeals to democracy and self-government aren't enough in a world where
generations have been taught to fear majority rule and the tyranny
it would seem to imply. How can we trust the people to govern themselves
with restraint? Would they not simply use that
power to bully minorities and enrich the well-connected few? Why
should we not establish a council of wise judges to gently guide the
people away from such tyrannical laws? To answer these charges, we must
descend back to Earth and explore the nature of governing institutions.

◊em{Democracy is majority rule}. The most sacred role of
a democratic system is to promote the general welfare over the special
interest. The general welfare is by definition a ◊em{majoritarian} interest,
while the special interest is a minoritarian one. Democracy must therefore
serve the majority by default, with concessions made only where
no other alternative exists.
This may seem a recipe for tyranny. Yet our shared humanity means
that policies which promote the general welfare benefit minority
and majority alike.
We all benefit from economic growth and stable prices. We all want to
feel safe in our homes and communities. We all want to leave the world
a better place than we found it.

Yet sometimes our earnest efforts to cultivate a decent society
cause harm. We may hurt minority groups because we don't appreciate
the dangers our laws pose to their dignity. Or perhaps we don't even
realize they ◊em{exist} as a group deserving our help. ◊i{National
minorities} based around ethnicity, religion, and language often
capture the world's attention, but they are the easy ones
to identify. It is the ◊i{embedded minorities}
 that exist within communities---those based
around ability, gender, or even handedness---that are trickier to
identify as needing special consideration.

Of course a decent society must look out for its minorities. But this
is often not a matter of will, but ◊em{knowledge}. Every human being
carries a layered set of identities: a citizen, a parent, a worker.
Each of us could be considered a minority at some level of generality,
but a society that promotes human dignity must find some way to
discern the vulnerable minority from the mere special interest. 

The line
between the two may seem obvious, but it seldom is; 
indeed, it often hinges not on the group itself,
but what they are asking of us. A civil rights group may 
fight for both desegregation and racial quotas; yet the former
proscribes discrimination while the latter requires it. Perhaps
both are necessary, but each must
be scrutinized on its own merits.
Simple, mechanistic solutions ◊em{do not} work, because they
are far more likely to be seized by entrenched interests
than struggling minorities. America's filibuster was
explicitly meant to protect minorities, but mainly allowed white Southerners
to block civil rights. The only real solution is
deliberation.

Such a task may seem foolish to entrust to a majoritarian government.
Why would the majority bother wrestling with such
questions instead of ignoring minorities outright?
 The answer is simple: laws that protect liberty benefit
everyone. They defuse social tension, enhance
institutional trust, and hearten those of us 
who believe in fighting for human dignity. 
Because laws that protect liberty are ◊em{positive-sum}
in this way, a society that remains politically free tends to 
move inexorably towards tolerance and goodwill---◊em{so long as}
each step is freely chosen, and generous rather than punitive.

◊;{But even liberty cannot always be absolute.}
But democracy is about more than just liberty.
Protecting the
general welfare forces us to recognize
that individual actions can harm society ◊em{collectively},
 requiring laws that
focus these diffuse costs back onto the individual.
This is not just true for environmental harms like pollution.
 It is also true for actions that erode cultural
cohesion and the rule of law---think public
urination, nudity, or drunkenness. Yes, appeals to the social fabric
can be taken too far, especially by social conservatives who
fret about moral decay. But the underlying principle is sound;
and any imagined harms will yield over time to social pressure
so long as minorities remain free to dissent and petition the majority.

The task of a free society is thus clear. It must strive above all
to promote the general welfare, balancing personal liberty with
the risk of collective harm.
 It must recognize groups that
deserve special protection: first by acknowledging their existence
and vulnerability, and then by judging each 
request on its own terms, seeking to expand liberty
without giving privileges at others' expense. It is a
bewildering problem, one that requires more knowledge than any
one person or campus can provide. It is a problem that is best
answered by a ◊em{parliament}: the organ with the greatest
concentration of rational knowledge in a society---and
the most democratic legitimacy.

◊(asterism)

The problem of governance requires not just science or
economics, but a deeper kind of knowledge:
the ordered set of preferences and values held by every
human being within society. Governing well is not about finding
a ◊em{right answer}, but about choosing the tradeoffs
that minimize social friction while hedging against the chance
that a policy will prove unnecessary or fail---an existential risk
for institutions that thrive on trust.
Take climate change: fossil fuels have lifted millions out of poverty.
How readily should we abandon them, even as
billions more yearn to follow? The answer hinges not on morals but
◊em{risk}, one that must be finely tuned to minimize angst and misery. 
It requires a knowledge beyond the ken of any technocrat or judge.

Such knowledge lives in a democratic parliament,
seeded with the high-stakes decisions of all its voters. 
At the ballot box, each citizen
weighs his layered identities, hopes, and fears, and
votes based on which one matters most at that moment.
Politicians race to address these concerns, and
the most convincing one gets a temporary lease on power.
But even after winning, the government must take pains to
avoid alienating voters, lest it imperil its
chance of reelection. Democracy is a constant dialogue
between parliament and society. Pollsters, analysts, focus groups: all
 information sought out for political survival.
The scientists and scholars matter too, but only if parliament
believes the voters can bear their prescriptions---or trust them.

A democracy is nothing but a parliament and its people.
Rights, precedents, and norms live within the people, not on
vellum. 
They therefore live and die by majority rule alone:
in a crisis, a leader who ignores the laws and flouts the courts
can only be disciplined by voters. 
Such a result would breed chaos, replacing predictable
laws with personal whim; yet
 it is the likely outcome
if a country's laws are frozen by courts. 
Its cause is a fundamental hubris:
if rights are contingent and change as we try to better
protect human dignity, then declaring them to be immutable
assumes what we are trying to learn. 
The system will hold while people still have faith in the constitution. 
Yet
by blocking efforts
to solve festering problems, the system makes that faith less likely.
◊;{Constitutional rights thus become worthless when they would 
be
most necessary.}

Some would respond to this brittleness by giving judges
an ever more active role in protecting rights. Yet
for all the real or imagined mistakes a parliament could make,
 why would a court do any better? The dangers
 are far from hypothetical: In Venezuela, the high court gave
 their strongman president despotic powers; in Thailand, they
 blocked liberal, reform-minded parties; in Bolivia, they
 allowed an authoritarian incumbent to skirt term limits;
 and in the United States, they endorsed segregation and eugenics. 
This may seem surprising, but it shouldn't:
 compared to the deep well of knowledge that flows through
 a parliament, that of a court is shallow, still, and stale.

Democracy has never been perfect. It has erred time and again.
But it alone carries the means for redemption and reform:
rich in knowledge, drawn from the people, refreshed
over time through elections. That is the essence of political
freedom: the power for a people to learn from the bitter
experience of their own mistakes. Yes, uniting
a society fractured by tongue and sect is hard. But the best
solution for holding together such diversity is through
◊em{more} democracy, by crafting federal systems that force
states to compete with each other. Sovereignty is not limited,
but redirected. The people can still choose, but they can also
move---and such threats themselves can chasten.

◊;{
your ending should restate the definition of political freedom,
then say:
elections aren't enough for political freedom. What use is an
elected Duma if its laws are vetoed by a Tsar? Or a President
who must supplicate to a jurist---theocratic or secular?
}

◊sc{All human beings} are born with a dignity greater than the 
entire universe. Yet for most of man's existence, that
dignity was betrayed by the limits of human rule, yielding
tyranny, hunger, and death.
It was through political freedom that human dignity became
not just a dream, but a program.
Its progress was made not in spite of its errors, but
because of them. Yes, the mistakes hurt. 
Their scars still humble us today.
But so long
as political freedom remained, the people could always
reclaim the rights they had let decay. In that sense,
political freedom is the wellspring of all other rights.
Once given away, it is gone forever.
There can be no more pressing a case for it than that.
