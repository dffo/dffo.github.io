There is something almost too easy about framing the struggle for justice in such terms. After all, we all want to believe that we are on the right side of history—and what can be more <em>right</em> than <em>rights</em>? The argument practically makes itself; yet this elegance is too often a curse, leading to circular arguments that shut down debate and turn thoughtful disputes over policy into empty moralizing.</p><p>Trying to define the term itself yields more questions than answers. A <i>right</i> seems to denote some kind of claim, imbued with a vague sense of justice. But what kind of claim is this? Is it a legal one, or a moral one? Do we press this claim against the government, the world, or the Almighty? Realizing just how formless the concept of <i>rights</i> is turns quickly from amusement to horror upon realizing just how many of our national and global institutions are built on its foundations. Its vagueness can give refuge to sophists who cloak fallacies in soaring rhetoric. Yet even the critics can fall victim to it.</p><p>Such vagueness dates back to the earliest form of our tongue. The Germanic tribesmen who lived two thousand years ago used the adjective <i>*rehtaz</i> to describe things that were <i>just</i> or <i>fair</i>. The word itself originally meant <i>upright</i> or <i>straight</i>, carrying a vague sense of alignment: the feeling that things were just so. But alignment with what? The law? Morality? A kind of heavenly justice? The noun that followed, <i>*rehtą</i>, was no clearer. And the malady was hardly confined to the Germanic tongues, for the French <i>droit</i> developed similarly from Latin (<i>directum</i>, whence <i>direct</i>), and has a similar ambiguity.</p><p>This tension between dream and realism, between aspiration and constraint, has carried forth to the word’s present form. A <i>right</i> can be both a legal claim against a government and a moral plea to the cosmos. It can benefit both individual citizens and collective groups, be they a faith, culture, or tribe. It protects the sanctity of process while also calling for a world free of want. It is both humble and bold; it meditates and screams. It is in that sense not the cause of confusion, but a reflection of our own: the tension of utopian dreams tempered by hard reality. Though it may be painful, cutting through the fog and understanding where rights go wrong may be the only way to give those dreams a chance.</p><p><span id="content-toc">Contents.</span> To better understand how <i>rights</i> work and where they fail, I’ve created a taxonomy that categorizes a given right in three different ways:     <a href="#positive-negative"><i>positive vs negative</i></a>,     <a href="#individual-collective"><i>individual vs collective</i></a>, and     <a href="#institutional-mphysical"><i>institutional vs metaphysical</i></a>. I discuss the virtues and limits of each kind, before ending with a more general <a href="#conclusions">analysis and conclusions</a>.</p><h2 id="positive-negative">Positive and negative rights <a href="#content-toc" class="back-to-toc" aria-label="Back to table of contents">↑</a></h2><p>Perhaps nothing bears the mark of the tension between idealism and constraint as clearly as the duelling concepts of <i>positive</i> and <i>negative</i> rights. Both kinds of rights are legal tools, not cosmic entreaties. Both are enforced against a government. But negative rights tend to yield a guarantee of <em>process</em>, while positive rights instead yield an entitlement to a certain <em>result</em>, often at the government’s (or taxpayer’s) expense. America’s First Amendment is a negative right: it guarantees your freedom to speak without harassment from the police, but it does not guarantee you a newspaper. That would be a positive right—the right not just to speak, but to be heard.</p><p>Positive rights have gained much more currency with constitution-writers over the past century. Many countries have added to their founding documents guarantees of <i>social rights</i> such as the right to housing, the right to healthcare, and the right to education. Traditionally understood, countries like the United States already have an implicit <em>negative</em> right to these things: its citizens are free to purchase whatever healthcare or housing they wish given the resources they have. The difference is that social rights are <em>positive</em> rights. They therefore  guarantee citizens the <i>entitlement</i> to these necessities, even if that requires taking money from the wealthier taxpayers to fund it.</p><p>We can see the tension between positive and negative rights. One often precludes the other: many countries with public healthcare limit the role of private doctors. Public schooling often comes at the expense of private schools: parents usually have to pay taxes to fund the public system even if they had opted out, implicitly penalizing their free choice. The right to be free from hate speech means that the government must restrict what others are allowed to say. The right to be forgotten means that the government must police what others are allowed to remember.</p><p>The negative right that loses the most from positive guarantees tends to be <i>property rights</i>. After all, social rights must be funded with taxes. Yet many critics on the left take issue with the idea that property rights are a negative right at all. Why treat property rights as a neutral guarantee of process when it yokes us to the unjust <i>results</i> of centuries of oppression? Marx famously described <i>capital</i> (physical assets used in industry) as really being the crystallized form of generations of workers’ labour. In this view, the distribution of wealth must be treated as a result with moral content.</p><p>Yet despite the moving appeal to history, the fact remains that property rights are inherently about process. Property rights are themselves less about <i>ownership</i> than about creating <em>zones of access</em> in which people can focus on cultivating what they have to bear fruit, without worrying about having it taken away or meddled with. Protecting this process of cultivation from interference has always been classical liberals’ greatest priority. Though they admit that a given <em>distribution</em> of property is more luck than merit, they argue that protecting people’s access to what they have over time gives a society the stability it needs to grow, benefiting rich and poor alike.</p><p>This focus on procedural stability tends to make libertarians and conservatives protective of negative rights, treating positive or social rights with suspicion. As Edmund Burke wrote, <q>What is the use of discussing man’s abstract right to food or medicine? The question is upon the method of procuring and administering them.</q> For many libertarians, the method implied by social rights—that of taxes and regulations that must be constantly tuned to satisfy the ever-changing needs of society—threatens the procedural stability needed for wealth to grow. They therefore tend to see negative rights as the only legitimate kind, casting any interference in them as immoral.</p><p>While their arguments are sound, such a rigid dismissal of positive rights goes too far, for some positive rights are essential. At the most basic level in a democracy, everyone must have the right to a polling station nearby. Even if this means the government must trek deep into the mountains to find its voters, the positive right to ballot access is too important to compromise with logistical concerns. Similarly, a free society must maintain the positive right to a fair trial, whatever the wealth or stature of either party. If winning a court case is contingent on having the highest-paid lawyer, law is once again reduced to <i>might makes right</i>, reverting to the natural, Hobbesian state of anarchy.</p><p>But things can get murkier still. <i>Intellectual Property</i> (<span class="acronym">IP</span>) rights, despite the name, are really positive rights rather than negative, procedural ones. Earlier, we characterized property rights as guaranteeing zones of access for people to work in without fear of loss. This doesn’t apply to <span class="acronym">IP</span>, as my use of your idea doesn’t deny you access to it. It is rather a guarantee of <i>result</i>, a forced exclusivity that requires the government to limit other people’s freedom of speech. In that sense, it is no different from hate speech laws: whether the government prevents someone from publishing racist hate or another’s poem, the mechanism is the same. It can only be justified based on its <em>social</em> benefits.</p><p>This opens the door to paths that would make libertarians uncomfortable. If certain positive guarantees are worthy for their social benefits, why not others? What about guarantees of freedom from discrimination? Why not protect the rights of the disabled by requiring buildings to be accessible? Why not, perhaps, guarantee some minimum income to prevent penury and squalor?</p><p>This is not to say that the libertarians’ critiques are wrong. Even social democrats admit that robust negative rights allow for the prosperity that brings positive rights into reach. But it does mean that there can be no easy, mechanical rule that vindicates some rights while dismissing others. Each must be considered on its own merits, in the context of individual and societal tradeoffs. Both positive and negative rights matter, but in a balance that must be discovered rather than dictated—a process of learning, not lecturing.</p><h2 id="individual-collective">Individual and collective rights <a href="#content-toc" class="back-to-toc" aria-label="Back to table of contents">↑</a></h2><p>There is perhaps no greater litmus test of one’s political philosophy than the place of the <i>collective</i> in society as opposed to the individual. Today’s progressives have gone impressively far in their embrace of collective rights, often seeing the world as a series of interconnected power struggles between privileged groups and oppressed minorities. Their conservative and libertarian critics often dismiss this as crass <i>identity politics</i>, with conservative thinker Thomas Sowell memorably framing such views as putting the plight of <q>abstract categories</q> over the lives of <q>flesh-and-blood human beings.</q></p><p>More generally, libertarians tend to see this subordination of individuals to group identity as part of the deeper illness of <i>collectivism</i>, whether embraced by socialists as the worker’s class struggle, by nationalists as the plight of the <em>volk</em>, or by modern liberals as the struggle of identity groups against structural privilege. Of course, all those groups dismiss such critiques as totalizing caricature, born of a hyperindividualist outlook that alienates human beings from their communities and cultural identities. But is there any place for the rights of the collective? Or should rights only apply to individual human beings?</p><p>First, we must distinguish <i>minority rights</i> from <i>collective rights</i>. The abolition of slavery protected minorities, but bolstered individual rights rather than collective ones, as it gave every individual citizen immunity from being pressed into bondage. The end of <i>separate but equal</i> was similarly based on individual rights—the idea that people should be judged by individual merit instead of colour. Collective rights take a different tack, granting certain guarantees based explicitly on race or tribe. Think of racial quotas or reparations: these give benefits tailored specially to members of certain groups.</p><p>Collective rights can also be positive or negative. Racial quotas that try to correct for unequal outcomes are clearly positive guarantees: they seek to cultivate a certain demographic result. But negative collective rights also exist. Think of religious exemptions to drug laws that allow certain Native American faiths to use the psychoactive <i>peyote</i> in their ceremonies. Such laws give members of a faith group a procedural guarantee, not a right to a given outcome. But resist the temptation to cast all positive collective rights as mere handouts, and all negative rights as noble. Literacy tests that mainly barred black Americans from voting were wrong because they had a disparate impact. And is it fair to give members of one group procedural rights, but not others?</p><p>The tensions go even deeper. At some level one could argue that nearly <em>all</em> rights are collective. Theft, for example, harms not just its immediate victim, but also society more broadly by weakening property rights and thus chilling investment. Violent crimes do the same thing; they weaken the rule of law, causing people to pull back and rely on private militias or vigilante justice. The role of law is to focus these diffuse costs back onto the agent who caused them, forcing people to internalize their actions’ collective costs to society. Yet such logic can easily be drawn ever further. What about collective harms to the environment? Does a society not have a positive right to clean air and water?</p><p>We can see the mistake in treating externalities like an inconvenient exception, as some libertarian thinkers implicitly do. Externalities are really the heart of law and governance. They are rooted in the collective nature of human society, and require difficult tradeoffs that must be negotiated. An even starker example of this is that of <i>parental rights</i> over the child—another uncomfortable edge case. Perhaps unintuitively, parental rights are not exactly about the right of an individual parent. They are rather about the sovereignty of the family as a collective decision-making unit, a sovereignty that is vested in parents who are deemed to be responsible.</p><p>Parents traditionally have wide latitude in how they use this delegated, collective authority, often with legally enshrined positive and negative rights. Many countries, for example, allow children to drink alcohol only under the supervision of their parents—a negative right granted to the collective family unit. The implied logic is simple: parents value their children more than life itself. To have the government try and rear their kids for them can be destabilizing when so many voters and taxpayers are parents. Yet even so, the bounds of this delegated power have limits. There are cases where the state must intervene to save the child from abuse, limits that must also be negotiated by society.</p><p>The exact contours of these limits can become overwhelming when they come into conflict with other collective identities. Take <i>tribal rights</i>, for example. In many parts of the world, governments recognize tribes as collective units, granting them some sovereignty over their members’ affairs. Much of this stems from recognition of the tribes’ venerable histories, as well as acknowledgment of abuses wrought by the government upon their members in the past, whether through forced assimilation, exile, or outright massacres.</p><p>But controversy can ensue when these rights conflict with others. Consider <i>Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl</i>, where a Cherokee father invoked the Indian Child Welfare Act to nullify the adoption of his daughter by a non-Native couple. The law had been passed to prevent forced assimilation through family separation. But this case proved morally hazy: the father had been distant from the mother and had already waived his parental rights. The adoptive couple was so invested in the child’s fate that they were even present at her birth. The ensuing controversy invoked difficult tradeoffs between tribal sovereignty, parental rights, and the welfare of the child.</p><p>Collective rights do not just include families and tribes. Consider the right of a faith group to carry out its ancient customs. We already touched on the case of peyote, where America’s government exempted a faith group from drug laws in recognition of their worthy traditions. But consider instead the case of circumcision, one of the oldest continuous traditions still practiced. Activists tar it as mutilation of a child who could give no consent. No faith group can force parents to circumcise their child if they refuse. But what if they want to? Do they not have the right to induct their child into their customs and communities? Do any customs go too far in risking the child’s welfare?</p><p>All these examples have been about <i>national minorities</i>: groups that pass down their membership through time, whether genetically or culturally. But what about <i>embedded minorities</i> that emerge from within communities and families? Do they not have rights? Take the Deaf community, for example, which has always struggled with the fact that many see their defining feature as a mere condition to be cured. Some children born deaf today can have their hearing restored with cochlear implants, which many governments subsidize. Yet many in the Deaf community fear that this would starve their community of new members who are fluent in their culture and sign language.</p><p>A parent who chooses to restore his child’s hearing is therefore making a decision that affects the future of a minority culture. The problem becomes especially pressing in countries with public health care: does funding for such devices risk erasing a community? Or is it a worthy cause for vulnerable children? Does a community’s right to exist trump the parents’ right to raise their child as they wish? This debate in particular is unique among disability rights. The case against eugenic sterilization, for instance, was that disabled people’s <em>individual right</em> to have kids overrode society’s collective right to police the gene pool. But here, it is individual rights that can harm disabled groups.</p><p>Some conflicts are easier to answer, though no less unsettling in their implications. Take the <i>pro-anorexia</i> subculture, a group of people who celebrate eating disorders and self-starvation. Though the gaunt images that emerge can be harrowing, its members claim it to be a legitimate community, one with a distinct culture and traditions. They claim that members participate consensually. But any assertion by such groups of a <q>right to exist</q> is wisely rejected by a broader society that recognizes them as promoting a mental illness rather than a worthy collective identity.</p><p>This case is especially striking because it shows that not all collective claims deserve respect. Our societies recognize that individual consent cannot justify such identity groups if the ends are self-destructive, and that children cannot give consent at all. But who should make that judgment? Is it the entreaties of experts that force our hand, or is it society’s deeper moral instincts that recognize when human welfare is at stake? Though the collective claim here is structurally similar to the cochlear implants debate, most people can intuitively distinguish cultural preservation from pathological harm. Yet that intuition, though essential, is ultimately all we have.</p><p>All these examples show that no simple rule can vindicate one collective identity but dismiss another. The libertarian framework stumbles because some collective rights are essential, and individual consent cannot always be accepted (especially for children). But we can see that a reflexive deference to all collective claims is also risky, because those claims often conflict, and not all of them are worth honouring. After all, eugenics is technically a collective right; but it is a rotten one. As with positive and negative rights, both individual and collective rights matter, but in a balance that cannot be prejudged.</p><h2 id="institutional-mphysical">Institutional and metaphysical rights <a href="#content-toc" class="back-to-toc" aria-label="Back to table of contents">↑</a></h2><p>Thus far our discussion has mainly concerned <i>institutional rights</i>, which are rights claimed against a government. Whether positive or negative, individual or collective, all these rights refer to some guarantee given to the citizen or group by their government, enforceable by law. Yet <i>right</i> isn’t always used in such a strict, legalistic sense. In a marital dispute, a wife who tells her husband <i>you have no right to tell me what to do!</i> isn’t appealing to some government statute, but to norms rooted in culture and tradition. Her spouse may be legally free to speak, but she believes him to be violating deeper customs.</p><p>These kinds of rights, which I call <i>metaphysical rights</i>, are categorically different from the institutional kind. They are not rooted in law or legal precedent, but instead emerge from normative ideas about how a man or nation <em>ought</em> to act. Despite the name, they are not all abstract declarations of human rights. Indeed, the concept is much older than that, often drawing from norms embedded within families and tribes. When in 842 <span class="acronym">AD</span> the Frankish king Charles the Bald swore an oath to protect his brother Louis, <i>soso man mit rehtu sinan bruodher scal</i> (<q>as should a man do for his brother <em>by right</em></q>), the <i>right</i> he was appealing to was the custom that binds kin to kin, not a legal text.</p><p>Crucially, such metaphysical rights are negotiated and enforced within a community, and judged subjectively by each of its members. Whether a husband sufficiently attends to his wife is for each to personally judge and negotiate among themselves. If a man feels betrayed by his brother, he may try to bring him under social sanction. Such judgements are not owned by any class or caste, but by all human beings with a stake in the community’s success.</p><p>While many conservatives dismiss any notions of universal <i>rights of man</i> or the <i><span class="acronym">UN</span> Declaration of Human Rights</i> (<span class="acronym">UDHR</span>) as a utopian, Enlightenment-era fetish for abstraction, we can see that claims to such metaphysical rights are not new. Indeed, in many ways they are simply the old ideas of customary duties extended to the global tribe of human beings; or in the case of international law, to the community of nations. Both the duties of kin and the <i>rights of man</i> are the same kind of right: grounded in normative ideals of custom, tradition, or humanity; judged subjectively by all members of the community; and living beyond the plane of courts or governments.</p><p>Institutional rights are very different. While negotiating within communities works well when the penalties are social sanction, things get more dangerous when man is compelled to use force. To maintain order, the people of a nation agree to yield their arms to a central, supreme power, which arbitrates disputes based on rules that have been explicitly agreed upon beforehand. Unlike with metaphysical rights, institutional rights are asserted by force, emerge from written law or precedent, and are judged dispassionately by an insular class of legal interpreters rather than by each stakeholder subjectively.</p><p>This is not to say that legal rights are untethered from custom or morality. Indeed, one of their most important roles is to regulate the use of force within a society in accordance with its mores and customs. This is necessary because a legal regime unmoored from the people’s beliefs will inflame social tension, destabilizing society. Yet institutional rights also serve another function, as touched on earlier. Because the state has the supreme power of enforcement over all people, institutional rights allow the state to control collective harms by focusing any diffuse costs back onto the person responsible. Thus murder and theft are not just immoral, but collectively harmful to the rule of law.</p><p>Despite the moral roots of law, judges cannot directly rule from metaphysical abstraction. Such metaphysical rights must first be <i>transformed</i> into institutional ones (law or precedent) to become judicially enforceable, a process that must be constrained by pragmatism. First, it can only extend as far as our ability to enforce it, lest it degrade into empty preening—this was the great error of alcohol prohibition. Second, it must seek to preserve continuity to avoid destabilizing society. Third, it must reckon fairly with the tradeoffs between competing claims—as noted previously, every right conflicts with another, and so the limits of a right are just as important as the right itself.</p><p>Finally, the transformation can only extend as far as the democratic nature of the institution enshrining the right into law. Domestic courts must therefore be more cautious than the legislature when creating new legal precedent. For example, it would be perilous for a court to unilaterally outlaw circumcision, given the delicate tradeoffs and social controversy it would involve. A legislature can act more boldly, constrained only by any bill of rights in their founding charter. International institutions must be most cautious of all, for they live very far from the voter. Such caution is vital because institutional rights that bind people <i>take away</i> their right to self-judgment—a precious thing.</p><p>This makes the traditional distinction between institutional and metaphysical rights crucial. It is dangerous to conflate the two by assuming that metaphysical rights bind other people without first being transformed into law through compromise and restraint. Edmund Burke understood this when he wrote in 1790: <q>Government is not made in virtue of natural rights, which may and do exist in total independence of it, and exist in much greater clearness and in a much greater degree of abstract perfection; but their abstract perfection is their practical defect.</q> It is a measure of our post-Enlightenment confusion that his words may seem a contradiction in terms: <i>how can rights exist yet not be binding on government?</i> It is because they are only metaphysical ideals.</p><p>The challenges of creating institutional rights are clearest in the global realm.  Because there is no supreme power to enforce international law, our methods must return to those of the Frankish kings, appealing to the brotherhood of nations rather than a coercive power bound by rules. The <span class="acronym">UDHR</span> is one example of such metaphysical appeals: beautifully aspirational, but mostly nonbinding. Global courts like the <span class="acronym">ICC</span> and <span class="acronym">ICJ</span> try to give it institutional force. Yet the game theory is fraught—without a global police, the loser must voluntarily concede in the belief that their opponents would do the same if they lose in the future. A single defection could destabilize the whole system.</p><p>The resulting incentives can be politically corrosive. To expect a democracy to meekly defer to an international court is to invite populist ire; for why should a democratic nation act against its citizens’ immediate interests? The state is ultimately not a charity. It is a union of citizens who freely associate, pooling their power to protect their interests while shielding them from individual liability. This may seem a cold-hearted view. Yet few politicians have won elections when the voters believed they were sacrificing their interests for others’. Indeed, that very suspicion has driven today’s populists to success.</p><p>The cost of judicializing metaphysical disputes goes further. It replaces the moral language of human beings with lawyerly cant, even as it fails to enforce any of it. It even clouds our view of history: <i>Did America have the right to bomb Japan?</i> <i>Did it have the right to expand west?</i> Debates today about Israel or Iran are often couched in similar language. The problem is not that it is <i>incorrect</i> to do so. But it cheapens the debate. It takes difficult, pragmatic questions—a democracy’s sovereign duty to its citizens, how best to balance power in a society where groups fundamentally do not trust each other—and dehumanizes them, replacing them with stuffy Latinisms and appeals to the dictionary.</p><p>It is true that in some cases, quasi-legal metaphysics may be all we have. The Nuremberg Trials, for example, were set up in the ashes of a Europe whose institutions lay in ruins. It served less as a court of law than as a tribunal for posterity; gathering evidence not to bind states, but as a warning to their children not to forget the horrors that had occurred. Metaphysical rights are therefore irreplaceable. If history repeats, we may need to call on them again. But we must not confuse them with institutional rights. They are not the domain of a lawyer, but of all human beings. It is they who must decide.</p><h2 id="conclusions">The lessons <a href="#content-toc" class="back-to-toc" aria-label="Back to table of contents">↑</a></h2><p>The most important lesson is that one cannot simply dismiss any one class of rights preemptively. Negative and positive, individual and collective, institutional and metaphysical—all matter in different contexts and under different constraints. Today’s most popular political philosophies tend to err in prejudging away entire categories of rights, whether it be the libertarians who dismiss all collective and positive rights, or progressives who defer too easily to any claim by a collective identity group.</p><p>But this is not an invitation to throw up one’s hands in resignation. The best approach is to try and understand the <i>domains</i> in which we should lean towards one class of right over the other. For example, the positive right to representation naturally matters more in government affairs, because the government is a kind of monopoly. People denied the vote via literacy tests had no other alternative. But other domains are more competitive, offering choices that can offset disparity. Even if your exam scores miss the cutoff to qualify for a given college, you can usually find another that will accept you instead. In such areas, ensuring procedural neutrality may be more important than trying to ensure positive representation by engineering demographic outcomes.</p><p>Another lesson is that <i>right</i> is not a magic word that automatically entitles you to the world. Some <q>rights</q> are in fact worthless—as noted previously, eugenics is technically a collective right. In <i>Buck v. Bell</i>, America’s Supreme Court infamously endorsed eugenics as being akin to vaccine mandates, which are also born of collective rights. Yet experience has shown the latter to be more defensible than the former. This shows that a right’s worth must be argued rather than assumed; simply asserting a <i>right</i> does not change things. Not all collective groups can justly claim rights in all cases, especially when rights conflict; and groups that promote self-harm cannot justly claim anything.</p><p>Finally, I believe that we should retire our metaphysical use of the term <i>rights</i>. Though this usage has deep roots, its popular confusion with institutional rights has turned it into a plaything of lawyers and sophists. To return these moral questions to the people, I believe we should replace our discussion of <i>human rights</i> with that of <i>human dignity</i>. Such a shift clearly grounds the debate in the domain of ordinary people rather than judges. It forces people to show how their preferred policies concretely benefit others, instead of simply declaring them a <i>right</i>—as if that made them self-evidently good. It thus shifts the debate from abstraction to practical concerns.</p><p>In that sense, the main lesson from this inquiry is the need for clarity. It is too easy for vague words to smother important debates, and no word is more difficult to use lucidly than <i>right</i>. In today’s divided politics, people too often use <i>rights</i> to shut down democratic debate, casting dissent as immoral while hushing any questions about tradeoffs or competing claims. Such rhetoric might be good for winning debates. But if it threatens the cause of human dignity for all, it is a victory unworthy of the name. <end-mark></end-mark></p>
